# Recipesweekly.ai

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

A system that helps you decide your daily food plan! It simplifies the process by showing different metrics to give a range of choices, all of which will tell you the nutritional value of the recipe and provide the required list of ingredients and where you can purchase them from. 


## Background

People struggle to figure out what they should make for breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday. This AI tool would help eliminate the excess time spent on worrying about ideas and make your life easier by giving you time to actually make the food and eat it!

Three simple mottos: Save your precious time creatively and conveniently!

## How is it used?

Recipesweekly.ai is for every day users who want to make their lives simpler in a chaotic world. 
This can be used in homes to offices to restaurants etc. 
There's no privacy issues as the system doesn't collect personal data besides location information if the user wants to see store recommendations.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data is collected from recipe websites and databases and nutritional value reports. Additionally this will use general location data.

## Challenges

This does not help the user figure out exactly which recipe they should pick since it will give them a list of ideas.

## What next?

We could add in processes that take into account dietery constraints etc.
